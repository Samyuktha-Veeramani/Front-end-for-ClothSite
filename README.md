TrendyThreads HTML Template - ReadMe
This project is a basic template for the TrendyThreads website, a fashion e-commerce platform that showcases stylish clothing collections and offers users an interactive shopping experience.

1. Structure and Features
HTML5 Document: The structure of this page follows standard HTML5 with Bootstrap 4 for responsiveness and FontAwesome for icons.
Header Section:
Contains the website logo, a navigation bar with links to key pages like Home, Shop, About Us, Contact, Blog, and Cart.
Includes a Change Color Button that toggles a background color change for the header.
An embedded contact form lets users submit their name, email, style preferences, and gender information.
Hero Section:
Presents a headline, subheadline, and a description of the latest collection.
Includes a call-to-action button to Shop Now and a paragraph about TrendyThreads' fashion philosophy.


2. External Resources
CSS Files:
Bootstrap CSS is linked from a CDN to manage responsiveness and styling.
FontAwesome icons are also linked via CDN for the shopping bag icon in the navigation.
A custom style.css file is linked for additional styling but not provided in this snippet (you'll need to define styles in it).


3. Form Components
The contact form includes fields for:
Name and Email
Style Preference (Casual, Formal, Party)
Gender (Male, Female)


4. JavaScript
A simple script is included to toggle the background color of the header when the user clicks the "Change Color" button.
javascript

function changeColor() {
    var header = document.getElementById('header');
    header.classList.toggle('header-bg');
}


5. External JS Resources
jQuery (for Bootstrap functionalities)
Popper.js (for Bootstrap dropdowns)
Bootstrap 4 JS (for responsive components like navigation)


6. To Do / Further Development
Add specific styles in the style.css file to control the overall appearance of the site.
Ensure the logo image is correctly linked by adding a proper path for Images/logo.png.
Set up separate pages for Shop, About Us, Contact, Blog, and Cart.
Add form validation logic and backend handling for form submissions.


7. Customization
Replace the current placeholder text and links with real content for the navigation bar and hero section.
Adjust styles for the buttons, text, and color scheme in the style.css file according to your brand's identity.
